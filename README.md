================================================================================

A Pragmatic scaffolding approach to build php api back-end with Symfony based on Telosys approach.

Goal

The project goal is to automatically deploy the configuration needed for an operational Symfony application based on php.

Software Requirements

    PHP 7.0 - a language and runtime.
    Composer - a PHP dependency manager.
    MySQL 5 - a relational database.
    MongoDB 2.4.9 - a document (NoSQL) database.
    Elasticsearch 2.0 - a search service.
